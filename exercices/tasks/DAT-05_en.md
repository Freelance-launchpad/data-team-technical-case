# **DAT-05** / Monitor the evolution of revenue for each freelancer


## Context
The Care Team needs to monitor the month-to-month evolution of revenue for freelancers. A stagnant revenue is not a good sign, and it is necessary to call the freelancer to understand their situation.


## Action
Create a report with the cumulative sum of revenue per month and per freelancer. It would be helpful to have a table like this:
| Freelancer Last Name | Freelancer First Name | Job Contract Start Date | Job Contract End Date | Entity | Month | Turnover (in â‚¬) |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| DUPOND | Albert | 2022/02/01 |  | blue | 2022/04 | 34,15 |
| DUPOND | Albert | 2022/02/01 |  | blue | 2022/05 | 67,15 |
